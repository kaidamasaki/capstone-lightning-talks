        <p>
          Lots of people like it because they miss the
          <del>merge conflicts</del> <ins>linear history</ins> that legacy
          version control systems had.
        </p>

        <p>
          More specifically it is a dangerous terrible hack that lets you
          lie about your commit history to make it appear that you all
          took turns making commits one-at-a-time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="dangerous">
        <h2>Dangerous</h2>

        <p>
          <code>git rebase</code> is dangerous because
          it <em>destroys commit history</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It takes commits <em>off of your branch</em> and "replays"
          them on top of the branch you want to rebase onto. These
          "replayed" commits have <em>no relation</em> to your
          previous commits.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's like you've kidnapped the originals and replaced
          them with clones.
        </p>

        <p>
          And like clones they don't have the same parents as the originals.
        </p>

      <section id="a-terrible-hack">
        <h2>A Terrible Hack</h2>

        <p>
          <code>git rebase</code> is a terrible hack because it
          doesn't preserve relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Git all of the logic that it uses to tell what changes
          are made between different commits and how to resolve
          conflicts is dependent on parent/child relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is <em>especially</em> true in the case where you're
          merging multiple branches into a single one over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without this information you often wind up resolving the
          same conflicts multiple times or sometimes even dropping
          commits.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="source-of-bugs">
        <h2>A Source of Bugs</h2>

        <p>
          <code>git rebase</code> is a source of bugs because it
          causes more merge conflits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having additional conflicts means that you wind
          up <em>resolving</em> more merge conflicts.  Since manually
          resolving merge conflicts is an error prone
          process <em>every time</em> resolve one you increase your
          odds of introducing a bug.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is especially true because you pay a lot of attention
          the <em>first</em> time you resolve a merge conflict but
          after that it's human nature to skim over it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="a-lie">
        <h2>A Lie</h2>

        <p>
          <code>git rebase</code> is a lie because you
          <em>didn't actually</em> take turns writing commits
          one at a time!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a somewhat minor issue compared to the above but not
          having the branching history accurately reflected can make
          it much harder to tell when a feature was started and
          finished.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be honest with Git and with yourself, unless it's
          your team's policy don't rebase your code.
        </p>
