        <h2>What is Lisp?</h2>

        <p>
          Lisp (short for "list processing") is actually a family of
          programming languages and not a single programming language.
          The first version of Lisp is from 1958.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lisp is notable for its early use of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Garbage collection</li>
          <li>Linked lists</li>
          <li>First class and higher order functions</li>
          <li>Macros</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="dialects">
        <h2>Dialects</h2>

        <p>
          Specific languages in the Lisp family are usually called
          "dialects".
        </p>

        <p>
          Notable dialects are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Common Lisp</li>
          <li>Clojure</li>
          <li>Scheme</li>
          <li>Racket (an offshoot of Scheme)</li>
          <li>Emacs Lisp</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="racket">
        <h2>Racket</h2>

        <p>
          Racket is a teaching focused offshoot of Scheme, the
          examples in this presentation will be written in Racket but
          the concepts are broadly applicable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Aside from the syntax Racket should be a fairly familiar
          language to you.  It's dynamically typed and uses functions
          as first class objects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where it will feel different is that Racket (as with most
          Lisps) doesn't have iterative constructs but instead relies
          on recursion.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="lists">
        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <p>
          The basic building block of Lisp programs is the List.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing about Lisp code is that it's actually a
          datastructure.  Any Lisp program is a series of lists that
          are executed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A typical function call looks like: <code>(function-name arg0 arg1)</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          One way to represent something as data is to use
          the <code>list</code> function:
        </p>

        <pre>
<span class="paren">(</span>list <span class="string">"dog" "cat" "rabbit"</span><span class="paren">)</span>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section id="syntax">
        <h2>Syntax</h2>

        <p>
          The biggest adjustment when learning to write/read Lisp is
          the syntax itself, or more the <em>lack</em> of
          syntax/abundance of parenthesis.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Here is a pretty standard greeting program:
        </p>
<pre>          
<span class="paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="paren">(</span><span class="def">greet</span> name<span class="paren">)</span>
  <span class="paren">(</span><span class="builtin">displayln</span> <span class="paren">(</span><span class="builtin">string-append</span> <span class="string">"Hello, "</span> name<span class="paren"> <span class="string">"!"</span>)))</span>

<span class="paren">(</span>greet <span class="string">"Ada"</span><span class="paren">)</span> <span class="comment">; Prints "Hello, Ada"</span>
</pre>
      </section>

      <section id="structure">
        <h2>Structure</h2>

        <p>
          Because Lisp is highly structured it's easy to reason about
          as a syntax tree.  
        </p>

        <p>
          In many ways this makes it resemble a markup language.
        </p>
<pre>        
<span class="paren">(</span>html
  <span class="paren">(</span>head
    <span class="paren">(</span>title <span class="string">"Lisp"</span><span class="paren">))</span>
  <span class="paren">(</span>body
    <span class="paren">(</span>section
      <span class="paren">(</span>h1 <span class="string">"Lisp"</span><span class="paren">))))</span>
</pre>
      </section>

      <section id="macros">
        <h2>Macros</h2>

        <p>
          Because Lisp is so datastructure oriented it's historically
          been much easier to write macros in it than other languges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Macros are basically functions that get to
          control <em>when</em> they evaluate their arguments.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, in a language that has macros it's common for
          something like <code>if</code> to be implemented as a macro
          that generates a <code>switch</code> statement.
        </p>
